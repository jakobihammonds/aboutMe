## Summary

Hi! My Name is Jakobi Hammonds. I am an avid programmer with lots of love for every surrounding area in the field, including, Engineering, Cybersecurity, Graphic Design, and believe it or not, even more than that! I enjoy a challenging workspace with a lot of creativity involved, doing the same thing over and over is not my cup of tea. Not to get controversial, but, I like dogs but I love cats even more, and for good reason! Who doesn't like cats?
